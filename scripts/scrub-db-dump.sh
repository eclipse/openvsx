Redacts sensitive columns from a per-table Postgres COPY-TEXT dump (as produced by
'\\copy <table> to ... with (format text, delimiter '\',\'')') before it's shared or used for
local dev/testing. Only touches personal_access_token.csv, signature_key_pair.csv and
user_data.csv - the other dump files have no columns in the redaction list below and are left
untouched.

What gets redacted (see the REDACTION step further down to change this):
  personal_access_token.value   -> deterministic fake hash, unique per row
  signature_key_pair.private_key -> 32 zero bytes (this column is NOT NULL)
  user_data.email                -> synthetic, unique per row
  user_data.full_name            -> synthetic, unique per row
  user_data.avatar_url           -> cleared
  user_data.auth_id              -> synthetic, unique per row (only where already non-null)
  user_data.eclipse_token        -> cleared (has held raw OAuth access/refresh token JSON)
  user_data.eclipse_person_id    -> cleared
  user_data.login_name is left untouched - it's the public registry username already.

How it works: this dump's exact column layout depends on which Flyway migration was HEAD when
it was taken (columns get added/dropped over time, and Postgres never reuses a dropped column's
position). The script spins up a scratch Postgres container and walks forward through every
migration from server/src/main/resources/db/migration one version at a time, checking the three
tables' real column counts after each one, stopping at the first version whose counts match the
dump files - no guessing, and no assumption that a future dump is from the same schema version
this was built against. That walk is O(n) migrations total either way (each step only applies
whatever's newly pending), just possibly with extra column-count checks along the way. Pass -t to
skip detection and pin a version directly (faster, and necessary if detection is ambiguous - e.g.
two versions in a row happen to match on count alone).

The scratch database only ever holds these three tables' data (plus whatever they cascade to via
foreign keys) and is destroyed when the script exits, successfully or not.

Options:
  -d <dir>       Dump directory (default: db/dump under the repo root)
  -t <version>   Skip auto-detection; migrate to this Flyway version directly (e.g. 1.71)
  -f             Overwrite existing *.bak backups from a previous run instead of refusing to run
  -h             show this help

If a file fails to import (Postgres reports a COPY parse error), the script stops and prints that
error verbatim - it names the exact offending line and content. This is NOT auto-repaired: past
corruption in this dump has been genuine data bugs (a missing closing quote, a stray unescaped
quote) with no reliable general fix, and guessing wrong on a redaction pass is worse than
stopping. Open the reported line, fix it by hand, and re-run.
