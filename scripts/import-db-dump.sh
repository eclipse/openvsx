Usage: $(basename "${0}") [options]

Loads a per-table Postgres COPY-TEXT dump (see scrub-db-dump.sh) into a Postgres instance - e.g.
the one 'docker compose --profile db up postgres' starts, matching
server/src/dev/resources/application.yml's connection details, which are this script's defaults.
The target can be either completely empty or already fully migrated - see below.

Deletes all existing rows from the 8 tables the dump covers first (children before parents, so no
foreign key elsewhere in that same set gets violated), then imports every dump file and fixes up
each table's id sequence so the running app doesn't collide with the imported ids on its next
insert. The whole delete+import runs as ONE transaction: if anything fails partway through -
including a table outside these 8 that has its own foreign key into one of them, which a plain
DELETE (deliberately not CASCADE) will refuse to run past - nothing changes on the target at all.

This does NOT figure out which Flyway version the dump predates (scrub-db-dump.sh already needed
to for its own reasons - if you still have that terminal output, reuse it here with -t). It uses
whatever's given via -t, or migrates a throwaway scratch container through the full history to
detect it, purely to learn each table's dump-era column *names*.

What happens next depends on the target's own state, checked by looking for these 8 tables (not
by table count, so unrelated tables - e.g. spring_session - don't confuse it):
  - None of the 8 exist: the target is treated as a fresh database and migrated directly, via a
    real 'flyway migrate -target=<detected version>' run against it, to the dump's own Flyway
    version - not to the latest one. Afterwards its schema is an exact match for the dump, so
    there's nothing to adapt. If you want the target on the current schema afterwards (e.g. to run
    the app against it), run 'flyway migrate' (no -target) yourself once this script is done.
    This migrate also applies server/src/dev/resources/db/migration (the 'dev' Gradle source
    set's own migrations, normally only applied by running the app locally that way) alongside
    the main ones, so e.g. V1_62_1's rate-limit tier/customer seed data ends up present too, the
    same as a real local dev run would have it. The one exception is the 'super_user' /
    'super_token' seed (V1_0_1 + V1_1_1): it touches user_data/personal_access_token, so the
    DELETE+import below wipes it regardless of having run - deliberately not reseeded afterwards
    (its own migrations' hardcoded id isn't guaranteed free in real dump data, and it's not worth
    reconstructing outside of a real flyway migrate just for this).
  - All 8 already exist: the target is assumed to already be on the current schema (the app or
    'flyway migrate' got it there), same as before. The dump's old column layout is adapted to fit
    via an explicit column list per \\copy, so newer columns the target has gained since simply
    keep their column default (with known exceptions backfilled - see KNOWN_BACKFILLS below).
  - Some but not all 8 exist: refused - this is neither state above, and guessing which columns
    are missing on a half-migrated schema is more likely to corrupt data than help.
Either way, the target is only ever touched starting at the DELETE+import step (or, for a fresh
target, the flyway migrate right before it).

Options:
  -d <dir>       Dump directory (default: db/dump under the repo root)
  -t <version>   Skip auto-detection; the dump is from this Flyway version (e.g. 1.71)
  -H <host>      Target Postgres host (default: localhost)
  -p <port>      Target Postgres port (default: 5432)
  -U <user>      Target Postgres user (default: openvsx)
  -W <password>  Target Postgres password (default: openvsx)
  -n <database>  Target Postgres database name (default: postgres)
