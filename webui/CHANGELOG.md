# Eclipse Open VSX Frontend Library Change Log

This change log covers only the frontend library (webui) of Open VSX.

## [next] (unreleased)

### Added

- Add a `/publish` page and turn the navbar's Publish button into a drop target: a file drag anywhere in the app turns the button into a drop area, and every `.vsix` package dropped on it — or on the publish page's own drop area — is queued and uploaded straight away, with no confirmation dialog. The page shows the queue as a line of extension cards — a skeleton while a package uploads, the real card once the registry accepts it, labelled with whatever the registry did with it — and keeps polling anything left under review or still missing its icon
- Export `PublishButton`, which carries the publish link, its `p` shortcut and the app's `.vsix` drop target in one component, so a deployment with its own menu content keeps drag-and-drop publishing
- Add a "Data Consistency" page to the admin dashboard (#1622): a live overview of every registered consistency check's finding count, with actions to refresh it and to fix findings one at a time or all at once
- Show a "Namespace not verified" state on an extension card when it can't be activated because its namespace already exists in a referenced external gallery and hasn't been verified, in both the "My Extensions" and namespace member extension lists. The card keeps its colour and takes a warning-toned frame and icon, since this is the publisher's to fix rather than an extension that is simply switched off
- Show a warning notice with a claim action wherever an unverified namespace is holding something back — the extension settings page when the extension has a namespace ownership conflict, and the namespace settings page for any unverified namespace — making clear the namespace must be claimed (verified) first. The action is the deployment's configured `elements.claimNamespace`, falling back to the namespace access documentation when none is configured. The admin dashboard's extension and namespace views show the same explanation without the claim action, since claiming is the publisher's action to take, not an admin's on someone else's behalf
- Add a "Search Index" page to the admin dashboard: which engine answers searches, how many extensions the index holds against how many it is built from, and a button to rebuild it where there is an index to rebuild. The two counts sit side by side because an index that has quietly lost entries answers searches perfectly well, just with nothing in them, which is indistinguishable from an empty registry unless both numbers are visible at once
- Mark a version that was published through a trusted publishing workflow with an icon next to "Published by" on the extension detail page, linking to the deployment's trusted publishing documentation. The default deployment points that link at the [Trusted Publishing](https://github.com/eclipse-openvsx/openvsx/wiki/Trusted-Publishing) wiki page

### Changed

- Redesign the user settings: a sidebar (a pill strip below `md`) navigating profile, access tokens, trusted publishers, extensions and rate limiting, with the user's namespaces listed alongside it and each one deep-linkable at `/user-settings/namespaces/:namespace`. Every view is rebuilt on the cards, grids, placeholders and theme shape tokens the rest of the site uses, and the namespace detail is now a single component shared with the admin dashboard
- Revoking a single access token asks for confirmation first, like every other destructive action
- Present the unsigned publisher agreement on the access tokens page as a warning notice with a link to sign it, instead of a plain paragraph
- Mark a removed extension version in red across its row — version number, status pill and timeline dot — and disable its delete action. Every version of a rejected extension is marked too, and "Latest" is reserved for extensions the registry actually serves, so one that is inactive or removed has no version marked latest
- Publish from the navbar's Publish button, the `p` shortcut and the settings Extensions tab through the new publish page, replacing the one-file-at-a-time publish dialog
- Add an `outlinedWarning` style to `MuiButton`, so a warning-toned outlined button follows the theme like the secondary and error ones instead of MUI's default half-opacity border
- **Breaking:** `elements.claimNamespace` now receives `{ namespace, extension?, sx? }` instead of `{ extension, sx? }`. The namespace settings page offers the same claim action and has no extension to pass, so implementations must read the namespace from `namespace` rather than `extension.namespace`
- Publishing goes through TanStack Query: `publishExtension` and `createNamespace` are mutation hooks (`usePublishExtension`, `useCreateNamespace`), and both service methods lose their `AbortController` parameter — writes are no longer aborted, and retries are the query client's to own. The user's extension list is a query too (`useUserExtensions`), read by the settings tab and by the publish queue as it follows a package, so a card appears in the list as soon as the registry has the package
- `ExtensionCard` accepts an `Extension` as well as a `SearchEntry`, and takes optional `to`, `linkState`, `overlay`, `footerStart`, `dimmed`, `tone` and `iconPending` props so other surfaces can reuse it instead of copying it

### Fixed

- Fix a React warning ("Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `notched`") from the admin dashboard's publisher role filter, whose custom `InputBase` doesn't consume the `notched` prop MUI's `Select` injects for the (unused) outlined variant
- Fix the admin dashboard Scan tab getting stuck on the loading spinner after switching tabs, even though the new tab's data had already loaded successfully
- Fix the page jumping to the top whenever a menu, select or dialog opens.
- Fix the extension detail page's download menu so each target-platform option is clickable across its whole row, not just its text: the option was an inline link nested inside a non-interactive menu item, rather than the menu item itself being the link
- Fix `sendRequest` re-enabling fetch-retry's own retries for the request that follows a 429 wait, because the recursive call didn't forward the original `retry` flag. A `sendStrictRequest`/`sendNonRetriableRequest` call that hit a 429 could end up having its follow-up request retried twice - once by fetch-retry and once by the query client
- Fix the create-namespace dialog acting on Enter when its button is disabled: an empty or over-long name was submitted anyway, and a held key sent the request more than once
- Fix `isError` counting an empty `error` string as an error, and make it and `isSuccess` answer a `null` response body instead of throwing on it (`typeof null === 'object'`). The registry aggregates per-version outcomes when deleting extension versions, so a delete where every version succeeded answered with an empty error next to the success message - which raised an error dialog with nothing in it

### Dependencies

- Remove the `react-dropzone` dependency; the publish page and the navbar's drop target handle their own drag events, and nothing else imports it
- Remove nine dependencies that nothing imports: `clsx`, `prop-types` and `punycode` from the runtime dependencies, and `@types/d3-scale`, `@types/d3-shape`, `@types/prop-types`, `@types/punycode`, `@types/react-transition-group` and `ts-node` from the development ones. All but `@types/punycode` and `ts-node` stay in the tree through MUI or the URL parsers that actually use them, so only those two leave the install
- Bump express from `4.22.1` to `5.2.1` and `@types/express` from `4.17` to `5.0`. Express 4 caps `qs` at `~6.14.0`, which is why a `qs` resolution was needed to move past it; Express 5 declares `^6.14.0`, so that resolution is gone and `qs` resolves to `6.16.0` on its own. The standalone frontend server's catch-all route is now `/{*splat}`, which is how Express 5 spells the `*` it no longer accepts
- Bump @humanfs/node from 0.16.6 to 0.16.8

## [v1.1.2] (20/08/2026)

### Added

- Add a "Forget user" action to the admin dashboard's publisher details, calling the GDPR erasure endpoint

### Fixed

- Fix the extension overview sidebar overlapping the readme content at narrower ("tablet") window widths: there are now only mobile and desktop layouts, with tablet widths using the desktop layout ([#2068](https://github.com/eclipse-openvsx/openvsx/issues/2068))

## [v1.1.1] (09/08/2026)

### Fixed

- Fix the WebUI build failing on s390x and ppc64le: use postcss instead of lightningcss (no ppc64le binary) for CSS, and bump vite for the Rolldown big-endian sourcemap fix ([#2051](https://github.com/eclipse-openvsx/openvsx/issues/2051))
- Fix the admin publisher revoke dialog prompting for an Eclipse login even when the target publisher's agreement status is `none` or could not be determined (nothing confirmed to revoke)

### Dependencies

- Remove the unused `@mui/base` dependency; it is deprecated upstream (replaced by `@base-ui/react`) and nothing in the codebase imports from it
- Bump socks from `2.8.3` to `2.8.9`
- Bump ip-address from `9.0.5` to `10.4.0`
- Bump postcss from `8.5.22` to `8.5.25`
