/**
 * One publicly visible transition of an {@link ExtensionVersion}: its publication, an administrative
 * deactivation, a reactivation, or its removal.
 * <p>
 * The log this builds up is append-only and is what the registry changes feed
 * ({@code /api/-/version-changes}) serves: an entry is never updated or reordered once written, so
 * consumers can page through the feed without skipping or repeating entries, and a version that
 * transitions repeatedly is reported once per transition instead of moving around in the feed.
 * <p>
 * Entries outlive the version they talk about. Purging a version only detaches its entries, clearing
 * {@link #getExtensionVersion()} while the copied coordinates keep identifying it, so that the feed can
 * still report that the version went away and the transitions consumers were already told about are not
 * retroactively withdrawn. That is also why the coordinates are copied onto every entry rather than
 * read from the version: there may no longer be a version to read them from.
