 * S3 {@code NoSuchKeyException}, a 404 from Azure/GCS, a missing local file) -- as opposed to some
 * other, possibly transient, storage error (network blip, throttling, permission problem). Callers
 * that can tolerate a resource's file already being gone (e.g. the size backfill migration, which
 * has nothing further to do for a resource that isn't there) can catch this specifically and treat
 * it as "no work to do" rather than as a failure worth retrying.
