    // on under Spring Boot 3. Several request DTOs have primitive int/long/boolean fields -
    // e.g. ExtensionQueryParam (the VS Code gallery query protocol, which this app does not
    // control the shape of) and ReviewJson.rating - that used to silently accept an explicit
    // JSON null for such a field (coercing it to 0/false) and now reject the whole request
    // with a 400 instead. Restore the previous, permissive behavior globally rather than
    // patching every affected DTO one by one.
