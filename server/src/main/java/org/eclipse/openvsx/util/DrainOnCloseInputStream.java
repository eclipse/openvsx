/**
 * InputStream wrapper whose close() drains whatever's left of a {@code maxBytes} budget that
 * normal reads haven't already consumed.
 * <p>
 * A request body that a validation check rejects before the body has been fully read can make
 * some load balancers/proxies mistake the resulting early connection close for a server error.
 * Wrapping a request InputStream once at the entry point and reading it exclusively through
 * try-with-resources makes draining automatic on every exit path - success, an early validation
 * throw, or anything added later - instead of relying on each call site remembering to drain
 * manually before it responds.
 * <p>
 * This does <b>not</b> itself enforce a hard limit on how many bytes a caller may read normally -
 * only close()'s own drain is bounded, to whatever remains of {@code maxBytes} once normal reads
 * are subtracted. Without any bound at all, a client rejected for any reason (invalid token, an
 * oversized upload, ...) could force close() to read and discard an arbitrarily large remainder
 * before responding, trading the original LB/proxy problem for a resource-exhaustion one; this
 * keeps close() itself from being the one to do that. The actual total (normal reads plus
 * whatever close() drains) only stays bounded near {@code maxBytes} in combination with a caller
 * that itself stops reading once it has seen enough to reject the request - e.g.
 * {@code ExtensionService#createExtensionFile}, which detects an oversized package after at most
 * {@code maxContentSize + 1} bytes. {@code maxBytes} should be that same "reasonable size" limit
 * the caller already accepts reading in full on the success path.
