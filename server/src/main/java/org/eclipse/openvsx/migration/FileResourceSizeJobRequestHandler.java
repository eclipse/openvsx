/**
 * Backfills {@link org.eclipse.openvsx.entities.FileResource#getSize()} for file resources that were
 * stored before the size was tracked, via a metadata-only lookup against the storage backend
 * (e.g. an S3 HEAD request) rather than downloading each file's content -- with potentially millions
 * of stored resources across a large registry, downloading every one of them just to measure it would
 * be far too slow and re-transfer an enormous amount of data for no reason.
 * <p>
 * Scoped per extension version rather than per file resource: an extension version's handful of
 * resources (download, README, CHANGELOG, icon, sha256 checksum, ...) are backfilled together in one
 * job, instead of one job per resource -- for a registry with millions of resources, that's a lot
 * fewer jobs for JobRunr (and this table) to carry for the same amount of work.
 * <p>
 * Disabled on mirror instances: mirrored resources are mostly served on the fly rather than stored
 * locally (see {@code PublishExtensionVersionHandler#mirror}), so there is usually no stored object to
 * look up metadata for in the first place, other than the download and its sha256 checksum.
