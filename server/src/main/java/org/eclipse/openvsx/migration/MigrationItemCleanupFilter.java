/**
 * Deletes the {@link org.eclipse.openvsx.entities.MigrationItem} row backing a migration job once
 * that job has actually finished successfully, instead of leaving completed rows in the table
 * forever (see <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-openvsx/openvsx/issues/1588">issue #1588</a>).
 * Deletion doesn't live at the end of every {@code *JobRequestHandler} because there would be a
 * lot of them to touch and to keep touching for every future migration -- a single JobRunr filter
 * that inspects the {@link MigrationJobRequest} on state transitions covers all of them at once,
 * present and future.
 * <p>
 * On failure (even after retries are exhausted) the row is deliberately left in place: the next
 * {@link MigrationScheduler} run will pick it up again via
 * {@code MigrationItemRepository#findByMigrationScheduledFalseOrderById}... except
 * {@code migrationScheduled} was already flipped to {@code true} in
 * {@link MigrationService#enqueueMigration}, so a permanently-failing item currently just sits
 * there for an operator to notice and investigate, the same as before this change. Fixing that
 * retry gap is out of scope for this sketch.
