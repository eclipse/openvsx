## SECTION 3 Submission, Approval, and Publication of Offerings.

a. **Submission Process.** You must submit a request for each Offering that you wish to publish in the Registry, and you must include the Listing Information and Offering Contents associated with such Offering.

b. **Responsibility.** You are solely responsible and liable for your Offerings and Offering Contents including all delivery and support. Eclipse may retain copies of the Offering, Offering Contents, and any other materials you submit and will not return them.

As between you and us, all goodwill associated with the Publisher Marks shall inure to your benefit. We may reformat or resize Publisher Marks as necessary and without materially altering the overall appearance of the Publisher Marks.

g. **Eclipse’s Use of the Registry.** While Eclipse will not directly monetize any particular offering, including your Offering(s), without the publisher of that Offering’s consent, Eclipse retains the sole right to decide how to display offerings and whether to promote some offerings above others, including your Offerings, Reviews, etc., as well to monetize the use of the Registry, including but not limited to: i) selling of advertising on the Registry, including the promotion of particular offerings, ii) offering, for a fee, enhanced performance of the Registry for specific users, and iii) soliciting financial contributions from users.
