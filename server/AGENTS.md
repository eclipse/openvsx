# AGENTS.md

Operating rules for AI coding agents working on the Open VSX registry server —
the Spring Boot application in `src/main/java`, built with Gradle. Claude Code
loads this file via `CLAUDE.md`; other agents read it directly.

This is the short, must-follow contract. If any rule here conflicts with an
explicit request from the user, ask before overriding it.

## Persistence: `EntityManager.merge` needs justifying, every time

`merge` copies a **whole detached entity** over the stored row. Any column that
changed since that entity was loaded is silently reverted. It is a write, even
where the surrounding code only means to read.

Never reach for `merge` to obtain a managed entity. Use
`entityManager.find(Type.class, id)` and set the fields you mean to change —
the setters are what persist inside a transaction.

Before writing or keeping a `merge`, answer all five:

1. **Is an update actually intended here?** If the method only reads, or only
   needs the entity managed so a lazy association loads, use `find`.
2. **Is the entity detached?** An already-managed entity makes `merge` a no-op
   that returns the same instance — the call is noise.
3. **How stale is it?** An entity loaded before slow work (VSIX parsing, a
   remote call) and merged afterwards will revert anything a concurrent writer
   changed in between, `active` included.
4. **Does anything depend on instance identity?** `UserData#equals` compares
   every field, so a `merge` can be load-bearing purely by making two
   references `==`. Compare ids instead — and reject an unassigned id, or an
   unpersisted entity makes the check fail open.
5. **Is the row still there?** `find` returns `null` for a deleted row where
   `merge` would try to resurrect it. Handle the `null`.

`merge` before `remove` works but emits a pointless UPDATE ahead of the DELETE.

This is issue #989, reported as a concurrent write to an extension being
reverted on a *read* path, leaving extensions inactive. Treat a new `merge` as
something to argue for in the pull request description.

## Non-negotiables

- **`./gradlew test` must pass before you commit.** Some tests start
  Testcontainers (Postgres, Elasticsearch, LocalStack), so a working Docker
  daemon is required; say so rather than skipping them silently.
- **`./gradlew spotlessCheck` must pass for the files you touched.** It is
  deliberately not wired into `build`/`check` (`enforceCheck = false`), and the
  repository has pre-existing violations elsewhere — so run `spotlessApply` and
  then **revert files you did not otherwise change**, rather than sweeping
  unrelated formatting into your commit.
- **New source files need the EPL-2.0 license header** (copy it from any
  existing file).
- **Never commit unless the user asks**, and stage only the files you changed
  (`git add <path>`), never `git add -A` / `git add .`.

## Project shape

- **Java 25** (`libs.versions.toml`). Dependencies are declared in
  `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, never inline in `build.gradle`.
- **Nullability is expressed with JSpecify** (`@Nullable`, `@NonNull` from
  `org.jspecify.annotations`), not Jakarta or Spring annotations.
- **`src/main/jooq-gen/` is generated and committed.** Never hand-edit it; it
  is excluded from Spotless. Regenerate it with `./gradlew jooqCodegen` after a
  schema change — that task reads a live Postgres, so it needs the dev database
  running.
- **Flyway migrations** live in `src/main/resources/db/migration` as
  `V<n>__Description.sql`. A migration that has shipped is immutable — fix a
  mistake with a new one. They are excluded from the pre-commit hooks.
- **Configuration properties** are bound in `*Config` classes with `@Value`,
  each documented with its property name and default, and validated in a
  `@PostConstruct`. A property with an invalid value should fail startup rather
  than misbehave later.
- The server has **no CHANGELOG** — only `cli/` and `webui/` do. Do not invent
  one; put the reasoning in the commit message and pull request instead.

## Deployment descriptors travel with the config

A property added, renamed or removed in the server has **four** homes that can
drift apart:

- `src/dev/resources/application.yml`
- `../deploy/docker/configuration/application.yml`
- `../deploy/openshift/application.yml`
- `../deploy/kubernetes/configmap.yaml` (the same document, indented inside
  `data:`)

The Kubernetes one was added later than the others and has twice been missed by
changes that updated the rest, leaving keys that silently bind to nothing. When
you touch configuration, diff all four and say which you changed.

## Changing code requires tests

- JUnit 5 with Mockito and AssertJ under `src/test/java`, mirroring the source
  package.
- For a bug fix, **confirm the test fails without the fix** — a regression test
  that passes either way is not one.
- Prefer a focused unit test over booting the whole context. A config class can
  be exercised with `ApplicationContextRunner`; note that a bare runner has no
  conversion service, so register one
  (`ApplicationConversionService.getSharedInstance()`) or `Duration` and
  collection properties will not bind.
- A change with no matching test update is incomplete. Say so explicitly rather
  than skipping silently.

## Workflow and code quality

- Read files in full before wide-ranging changes, and before editing files you
  have not inspected. Do not rely on search snippets.
- Keep code comments short (1–3 lines): state only the non-obvious constraint or
  rationale, never narrate what the code does.
- Ask before removing functionality or code that appears intentional. Do not
  preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for it.
- A configuration property that has never appeared in a release can be renamed
  outright; one that has shipped needs a fallback to its old key (see
  `ovsx.access-token.prefix`). Check the tags before assuming either.

## Conventions

- Commit subjects use a conventional-commit prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
  `docs:`, `test:`, `style:`, `build:`, or `ci:`.
- No emojis in commits, pull requests, issues, or code. Keep prose concise,
  direct, and technical — no cheerful filler.
- Answer a user's question before making edits or running implementation
  commands.
- When responding to feedback or an analysis, say whether you agree or disagree
  before describing what you changed.

## Git

Multiple sessions may be running in this cwd at the same time, each modifying
different files. Git operations that touch unstaged, staged, or untracked files
outside your own changes will stomp on other sessions' work. Follow these rules:

Committing:

- Only commit files YOU changed in THIS session.
- Stage explicit paths (`git add <path1> <path2>`); never `git add -A` / `git add .`.
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging your files.

Never run (destroys other agents' work or bypasses checks):

- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`,
  `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit --no-verify`.

If rebase conflicts occur:

- Resolve conflicts only in files you modified.
- If a conflict is in a file you did not modify, abort and ask the user.
- Never force push.
